# Evolution of genes - project C1
### Motivation

### Goals

The goal of the project was to implement global alignment algorithm. We scored each nucleotide in a given sequence by how many times it alings within the dataset. We experiment with different scoring functions and alingments. We also compared difference in alingment between aminoacid and nuqleotid sequence.

### Dataset

The dataset consist of genome of 3 different nematodes (round worms) - japanica, brenneri and remanei. It is common for this group of nematodes that their genome contains a vast ammount of redundancy. This means that not whole genes are translated into proteins. Parts that end up in protein are called exons nad parts that do not are called introns. Part of genes given in dataset contains at least two exons.
